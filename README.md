## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone the project from GitHub and open it in a code editor like VS Code.

2. Set up the backend by going into the server folder, installing the required packages using npm install, and creating a .env file. In that file, you must add your own MongoDB connection string (MONGO_URI) and a secret key (JWT_SECRET), make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual details.

3. Start the backend server using npm start after setting up the environment file. Then go to the client folder, run npm install to install frontend dependencies, and start the frontend with npm start.

4. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to use the Job Tracker App. Youâ€™ll now be able to register, log in, and manage job applications.
